    Chris has been a professional web developer since 2007 and made his first website
    on geocities.com when he was 11. He was a big fan of
    <code>&lt;blink&gt;&lt;/blink&gt;</code> and was deeply saddened when it became a 
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blink" class="accent-hover">deprecated element.</a>
    For Savas, Chris most enjoys providing bespoke solutions for clients, and writing in
    the third person. When Chris is not behind the computer, heâ€™s probably doing something
    related to a bicycle. He is the Board President of nonprofit hospitality network WarmShowers.org,
    serves on the board of his local bicycle advocacy organization Bike Durham, founded a
    bicycle-powered food scraps recycling company called Tilthy Rich Compost, and rode his
    bicycle 6,000 miles across the U.S. in the summer of 2008.
