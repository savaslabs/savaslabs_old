    Chris has been a professional web developer since 2007 and made his first website
    on geocities.com when he was 11. He was a big fan of
    <code>&lt;blink&gt;&lt;/blink&gt;</code> and was deeply saddened when it became a 
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blink">deprecated element.</a>
    For Savas, Chris most enjoys providing bespoke solutions for clients, and writing in
    the third person. When Chris is not behind the computer, heâ€™s probably doing something
    related to a bicycle. He is the Board President of nonprofit hospitality network WarmShowers.org,
    he serves on the board of his local bicycle advocacy organization Bike Durham, he founded
    a bicycle-powered food scraps recycling company called Tilthy Rich Compost, and rode his bicycle
    6,000 miles across the U.S. in the summer of 2008.

    Anne received a B.S. in textile engineering and worked at a Contract Research
    Organization for five years before realizing that she actually wants to be a web developer.
    She joins Savas as a fairly new developer with an interest in the front end, particularly
    Sass and CSS3. Besides furiously studying to become a computer geek, Anne enjoys cooking,
    playing old Zelda games, and all things musical. She plays piano (and occasionally ukulele)
    in local bands My Brother, My Sister and Jon Sebastian and the Tresspassers, who
    had a <a href="http://jonsebastian.bandcamp.com/track/nightmare-sisters">song</a>
