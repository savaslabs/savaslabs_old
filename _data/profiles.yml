    Chris Russo has been a professional web developer since 2007 and made his
    first website on geocities.com when he was 11. He was a big fan of the <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blink">blink</a>
    element and was deeply saddened when it became a deprecated element.
    For Savas, Chris most enjoys providing bespoke solutions for clients,
    and writing in the third person. When Chris is not behind the computer,
    he’s probably doing something related to a bicycle. He is the Board President
    of nonprofit hospitality network WarmShowers.org, he serves on the board of his
    local bicycle advocacy organization Bike Durham, he founded a bicycle-powered
    food scraps recycling company called Tilthy Rich Compost, and rode his bicycle
    6,000 miles across the U.S. in the summer of 2008.

    Anne Tomasevich studied engineering and worked at a Contract Research Organization
    for five years before realizing that she actually wants to be a web developer. She
    joins Savas as a fairly new developer with an interest in the front end, particularly
    Sass and CSS3. She just read a book about CSS3 and is inordinately excited about it.
    Besides furiously studying to become a computer geek, Anne enjoys cooking, playing
    old Zelda games, and all things musical. She plays piano (and occasionally ukulele)
    in local bands My Brother, My Sister and Jon Sebastian and the Tresspassers. The
    latter band had a <a href="http://jonsebastian.bandcamp.com/track/nightmare-sisters">song</a>
    featured on NPR Music's Favorite Songs of 2014.
